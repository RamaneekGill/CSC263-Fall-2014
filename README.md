Data Structures and Analysis

Taught by Francois Pitt at UofT

Algorithm analysis: worst-case, average-case, and amortized complexity. Expected worst-case complexity, randomized quicksort and selection.  Standard abstract data types, such as graphs, dictionaries, priority queues, and disjoint sets. A variety of data structures for implementing these abstract data types, such as balanced search trees, hashing, heaps, and disjoint forests. Design and comparison of data structures. Introduction to lower bounds.

This repo contains all the problems sets I've done for the course. The course was mainly about mathematical and logical proofs on data structures such as binary heaps, linked lists, heaps, graph theory and more.
